      <h1 class="character__h1">Walter White</h1>
      <h2 class="character__text">
        Walter Hartwell "Walt" White Sr., also known by his clandestine
        pseudonym and business moniker Heisenberg and also frequently referred
        to as Mr. White, is a former chemist and major narcotics distributor
        from Albuquerque, New Mexico, whose drug empire became the largest
        meth operation in American history, surpassing both Gustavo Fring's
        drug empire and the Cartel's. Before entering the drug trade, Walt was
        a respected chemist and scientist who later worked as an overqualified
        high school chemistry teacher at J. P. Wynne High School alongside
        working at the A1A Car Wash to financially support his family (his
        wife Skyler, son Walt Jr., and infant daughter Holly). After being
        diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Walt started manufacturing
        chemically pure crystal methamphetamine to provide for his family upon
        his death. Knowing nothing about the drug trade, Walt enlisted the aid
        of his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to sell the meth he produced.
      </h2>
      <h2 class="character__text">
        Walt's scientific knowledge and dedication to quality lead him to
        produce crystal meth that is purer and more potent than any
        competitors'. To avoid the tedious collection of pseudoephedrine
        required for production, Walt devises an alternative chemical process
        utilizing methylamine, giving his product a distinctive blue colour.
        His crystal meth, which is given the street name "Blue Sky," dominates
        the market, leading to confrontations with established drug makers and
        dealers. Although Walt and Jesse began as amateur small-time meth
        cooks, manufacturing the drug out of an RV in the deserts of New
        Mexico, and being met with very limited success, Walt and Jesse soon
        climbed up the drug hierarchy, killing or systematically destroying
        anyone who impeded them. Because of his drug-related activities, Walt
        eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement
        Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law and accomplished DEA
        agent Hank Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels
        (including their regional distributors), putting him and his family's
        lives at risk.
