          Walter Hartwell "Walt" White Sr., also known by his clandestine
          pseudonym and business moniker Heisenberg and also frequently referred
          to as Mr. White, is a former chemist and major narcotics distributor
          from Albuquerque, New Mexico, whose drug empire became the largest
          meth operation in American history, surpassing both Gustavo Fring's
          drug empire and the Cartel's. Before entering the drug trade, Walt was
          a respected chemist and scientist who later worked as an overqualified
          high school chemistry teacher at J. P. Wynne High School alongside
          working at the A1A Car Wash to financially support his family (his
          wife Skyler, son Walt Jr., and infant daughter Holly). After being
          diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Walt started manufacturing
          chemically pure crystal methamphetamine to provide for his family upon
          his death. Knowing nothing about the drug trade, Walt enlisted the aid
          of his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to sell the meth he produced.

        <h2 class="character__text">
          Walt's scientific knowledge and dedication to quality lead him to
          produce crystal meth that is purer and more potent than any
          competitors'. To avoid the tedious collection of pseudoephedrine
          required for production, Walt devises an alternative chemical process
          utilizing methylamine, giving his product a distinctive blue colour.
          His crystal meth, which is given the street name "Blue Sky," dominates
          the market, leading to confrontations with established drug makers and
          dealers. Although Walt and Jesse began as amateur small-time meth
          cooks, manufacturing the drug out of an RV in the deserts of New
          Mexico, and being met with very limited success, Walt and Jesse soon
          climbed up the drug hierarchy, killing or systematically destroying
          anyone who impeded them. Because of his drug-related activities, Walt
          eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement
          Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law and accomplished DEA
          agent Hank Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels
          (including their regional distributors), putting him and his family's
          lives at risk.
